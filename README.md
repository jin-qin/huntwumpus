# Hunt the Wumpus

## Prerequisites
1. CMake latest release
2. make tool (for Linux and MacOS) or visual studio (for Windows)

## Build
1. Linux & MacOS
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build && cmake ..
    make
    ```
2. Windows
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build && cmake ..
   ```
   `open solution with your visual studio`

## Run
1. `./huntwumpus`, this will generate a **5x5** map **RANDOMLY**.
2. `./huntwumpus <map_file_path.json>`
   - Sample map files are in the `./test_data/maps`, you **ONLY** need to specify the positions of **Pit** as **P**, **Wumpus** as **W** and **Gold** as **G**, **DO NOT** try to specify **Breezy** or **Stench**, because sometimes you may make mistakes on typing it and they can be generated by the program with respect to the **Pit** and **Wumpus**.

## Test Cases
There are three test maps in `./test_data/maps`:
- `map_0.json` is the first map on the **Blackboard**.
- `map_1.json` is the map  named **'Wumpus world 2'** on the **Blackboard**.
- `map_2.json` is the map named **'Another wumpus map'** on the **Blackboard**.

The outputs of these three test maps were pre-generated and put in `outputs.zip`
